## How can I contribute?

If you have an issue with NEBULA: look whether the issue you have [already exists](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA/issues) or make a [new issue](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA/issues/new), and [create a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your changes from a fork or a branch.

If you want to contribute but do not know where to start, look for [an issue you can pick up](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA/issues), or contact the development team via j.camphuijsen@esciencecenter.nl for more guidance.
