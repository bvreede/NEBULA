Which can be generated using the following chapter heading:\n\n```markdown\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Image\" image=\"multimedia_image.avif\"}\n```\n\n:::\n\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Video\" video=\"IuWVAv0AxXY\"}\n\n## Video example\n\nThis is a video hosted on youtube. You have to specify the youtube ID in the chapter header.\n\n```markdown\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Citation\" video=\"IuWVAv0AxXY\"}\n```\n\nThe youtube video ID can be found in the url of your youtube video, after the url tag \"v=\" (e.g. w<span>ww.</span>youtube.com/watch?v=**IuWVAv0AxXY**). Note that any following ampersand (&) symbols mark the end of the ID.\n:::\n\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Presentation 1\" presentation=\"presentation.md\"}\n\n:::\n\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Website\" website=\"https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/software-support-essentials/\"}\n\n## Website example\n\nYou can also embed a website... software support inception...\n\nIt can be done by adding the website prop with the url to the chapter heading:\n\n```markdown\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Website\" website=\"https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/software-support-essentials/\"}\n```\n\n:::\n\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Wide Markdown\" widemd=1}\n\n## Wide Markdown\n\nThis type of chapter is used for all markdown. The small left text panel becomes screen wide and there is no media panel. It can be done by adding the `widemd` prop:\n\n```markdown\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Wide Markdown\" widemd=1}\n```\n\nSomething has to be added in the widemd prop, 1 is generally a safe value. Note that 0 will not turn it off; the only way to disable `widemd` is simply to remove the prop entirely.\n\nAn image can also be added here of course, as in any markdown. But do note that the path needs to be relative to the `static` directory that lives in root of this project.\nBecause the image lives in `static/stories/_multimedia`, the path to the image on this page should read `stories/_multimedia/multimedia_image.avif`.\n![This is the same image as in the image chapter.](stories/_multimedia/multimedia_image.avif)\n\n:::\n\n\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Presentation 2\" presentation=\"presentation.md\"}\n\n:::\n\n:::Chapter{headline=\"Wall of Text\" widemd=1}\n\n## Wall of Text\n\nThis is a chapter with a lot of text.
