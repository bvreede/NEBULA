The fact that the thing that operates the machine (software) is the same kind of thing as the thing it operates on (data) is definitely one of the strengths of current computersystems and one of the main reasons why we can do such complex and powerful things with the combination of hardware and software.\n\nRead the following blogpost about why this concept is so powerful:\nhttps://www.blackliszt.com/2014/04/fundamental-concepts-of-computing-software-is-data.html\n\n\n### Software is a special type of data ()\nHowever for most practical purposes in most domains of scientific research (except maybe the domain of computer science) it is useful to make a distinction between the data that is software and other data. From now on, when we use the word data, we mean the kind fo data which is not software and which we use to store more static information.\n\n- Software is executable, data is not.\n- Data provides information or evidence, software provides a tool to do work on the data.\n- Software is a creative work, scientific data are facts or observations.\n- The lifetime of software is generally not as long as that of data.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/danielskatz/software-vs-data\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2630v1\n\n\n### Discussion\n\n- \n- Can you think of examples where the line between software and data becomes fuzzy?\n"}]
