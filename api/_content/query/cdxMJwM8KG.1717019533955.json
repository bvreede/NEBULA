The source code implementing the algorithm is available for download.\n\nIs this \"research software\" or \"software in research\"?\n\n#### SciPy\n[SciPy](https://zbmath.org/software/6293) is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.\nIt is also the name of a very popular conference on scientific programming with Python. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation.\nThe SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.\nTogether, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge.\nNumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the worldâ€™s leading scientists and engineers.\n\nIs this \"research software\" or \"software in research\"?\n\n### Other software tools\nHow about other software tools you are familiar with?\nCan you provide an example of software you are familiar with, and then classify it as \"research software\" or \"software in research\"?\n"}]
