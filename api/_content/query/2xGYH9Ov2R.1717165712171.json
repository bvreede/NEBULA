A software management plan helps to implement best practices during software development and ensures that software is accessible and reusable in the short and longer term. It also contributes to the reproducibility of results and stimulates collaborative work on open-source software for research.\n\nIn practice, a software management plan helps:\n\n- Assess whether developing new software is necessary\n- Plan to make the research software reusable and sustainable\n- Plan for necessary resources\n- Allow for verification of work that went into implementation\n\nIn the Practical Guide to Software Management plans, this is described in more detail:\n\n[A practical guide to software management plans](https://zenodo.org/record/7589725)\n\nAfter reading this guide, you should:\n\n- Be aware of different types of research software\n- Understand different demands placed on these types of software\n- Know about various aspects of software management\n- Be able to explain the importance of a software management plan for software sustainability."},{"_path":"/modules/smp/exercise3","_dir":"smp","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Exercise 3","description":"","type":"exercise","order":4,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:smp:exercise3.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/smp/exercise3.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Exercise 3\ntype: exercise\norder: 4\n---\n\n# Exercise 3\n\n## SMP vs FAIR\n\n### Why do we care?\n\nWhen thinking of the importance of good software stewardship, management, and development practice, many reasons and motivations come to mind.\nYou may think of:\n\n- Accuracy of results\n- Reproducibility of results\n- Reusability of software\n- User friendliness of software\n- Software quality\n- Recognition and rewards for software developers\n- Scholarly archive\n- Software sustainability\n\nWhat are the reasons and motivations that come to mind for you?\n\n### Mapping motivations\n\n(**NB:** If you are not yet familiar with the FAIR principles for research software, [take a look at the chapter on FAIR software](/modules/fairsoftware.md) before doing the following exercise.)\n\nThe motivations we listed above were important considerations for the development of Software Management Plans as well as the FAIR principles for research software.\nThey do not match completely, however.\nEach has its own focus and emphasis.\n\nIn the following exercise, we will map the motivations we listed above to the ultimate goals of SMPs and the FAIR principles.\n\nDraw a Venn diagram with two circles: SMP and FAIR:\n\n<img src=\"media/venn_fairsmp.png\" width=\"400\">\n\nMap the motivations listed above to the Venn diagram.\n\n- Which motivations are covered by SMPs, which by FAIR, and which by both?\n- Do you find any motivations that are not covered by either?\n- What does this tell you about the relationship between SMPs and FAIR?"}]
