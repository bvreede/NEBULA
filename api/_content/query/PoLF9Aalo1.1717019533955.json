What is the current reason or expected end-use for developing the software?\n2. **Reliability**. The effect of software failure and/or non-maintenance on:\n    - Risk of harm to self or others. This includes injury, privacy violation, bias, and inappropriate content.\n    - Reputation. For example to self, institution or other.\n    - Research, either your own or of others. This effect could be due to an obvious software failure (\"crash\") or a hidden one, for example, returning inconsistent numerical results on different operating systems.\n3. **Maintenance**. The long-term effort needed to maintain the software as long as it might be used as a standalone tool or dependency. This includes maintenance functions that can extend beyond the lifespan of the original development project and includes fixing bugs, dependency management, operating system compatibility, and security issues.\n\nThis may not be a clear-cut decision, but that is fine.\nThe goal is to get a sense of the level of management needed.\nDiscuss with your group and come to a consensus.\n\n## Step 3: Fill in the SMP template\n\nFrom the assessment made in Step 1, get the requirements that match the level of management needed.\n\nCopy a template, and fill it in for your software project."},{"_path":"/modules/smp","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Management Plans","description":"thumbnail-smp","id":1,"trl":"medium","category":"Reusability","author":"eScience Center","thumbnail":"thumbnail-smp.jpg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:smp:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/smp/index.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\nid: 1\ntrl: medium\ncategory: Reusability\ntitle: Software Management Plans\nauthor: eScience Center\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-smp.jpg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n[thumbnail-smp](https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-pencil-near-laptop-computer-5fNmWej4tAA?utm_content=creditShareLink&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@homajob?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Scott Graham</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-pencil-near-laptop-computer-5fNmWej4tAA?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>"}]
