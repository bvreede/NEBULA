Proprietary software is software that isn't FOSS, which is to say that it has restrictions on use or modification or distribution. It's called proprietary because there is a proprietor or (copyright) owner, who has exclusive control over the software. For Open Source this is not the case: there is a copyright and it's owned by someone, but the license gives everyone else the same permissions they have and so they don't have exclusive control.",{"type":20,"tag":21,"props":564,"children":565},{},[566],{"type":32,"value":567},"Within the category of Open Source licenses, we can distinguish Copyleft licenses and Permissive licenses.
